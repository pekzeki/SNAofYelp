Social Network Analysis on famous Yelp Dataset 

# Desc
The dataset that was used in this project is available at http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challengeÂ . Yelp provided a big dataset for public usage that includes information about local businesses, reviews and users in 10 cities across 4 countries. Other than business, user and review information it also contains some additional information such as, check-ins and tips. The basic entity relations and the samples from json files represented below. Unfortunately, lack of CPU and memory resources  the dataset was filtered. Instead of using all cities we just used the yelp data of Illinois.
